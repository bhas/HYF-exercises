## Next Birthday Countdown
1. Investigate how we can work with dates in Javascript and explain it to a classmate and a mentor.
   * How can I get today's date?
   * How can I get Jan 16th 1992?
   * What kind of operations can I do with dates?
2. Write a function `daysUntilBirthday` that takes a birthdate (YYYY-MM-DD) as input and returns the number of days until the next birthday.
    ```js
    console.log(daysUntilBirthday("1995-06-15")); // Outputs the number of days until June 15 next occurrence
    ```
