### Tips

#### Principles
* âœ… Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY) â€“ Avoid duplicating code by using functions, loops, or reusable components.
* âœ… Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) â€“ Each function or module should do only one thing well.
* âœ… Write self-documenting code â€“ Use meaningful variable and function names instead of relying on excessive comments.
* âœ… Keep it simple (KISS) â€“ Write code that is as simple as possible while still solving the problem.
* âœ… Avoid premature optimization â€“ Focus on clarity first, optimize only when needed.

#### Improving existing code

#### Writing maintainable code
ðŸ”¹ Consistent Formatting â€“ Use a code formatter (Prettier, Black, ESLint) to enforce styling.
ðŸ”¹ Use Descriptive Names â€“ Avoid single-letter variable names (except in loops). Example:
ðŸ”¹ Write Small Functions â€“ Each function should do one thing and be reusable.
ðŸ”¹ Minimize Side Effects â€“ Use pure functions where possible to avoid unexpected behavior.

#### Troubleshoot issues
ðŸ›  Use print statements/logging first before using a debugger.
ðŸ›  Break down big problems into small steps â€“ Solve one part at a time.
ðŸ›  Rubber duck debugging â€“ Explain your issue out loud (or to an actual duck) to clarify your thinking.

#### Learn and read documentation

#### Be curious



#### Working with Git
* pull from main
* branch per task
