[!TIP]
> **Divide and Conquer** is a programming technique that breaks a problem into smaller, more manageable subproblems, solves them individually, and then combines their solutions to solve the original problem. It is used to reduce problem complexity and making it easier to implement a solution and estimate the effort required.

> [!TIP]
> When refactoring existing code there is always a risk that we introduce bugs, so it is crucial that you take precautions to reduce the risk of introducing bugs. Here are some good steps to follow which limits these risks:
> 1. **🔍 Understand the Code**: Thoroughly read and understand the existing code.
> 2. **📝 Plan Changes**: Outline the changes you intend to make and weigh the effort required against the benefits.
> 3. **🧪 Create Test Scenarios**: Develop test scenarios and document their expected outcomes.
> 4. **💻 Implement Changes**: Make the necessary code changes.
> 5. **✅ Verify Functionality**: Ensure that your test scenarios still pass after the changes.


> [!TIP]
> Effective troubleshooting involves a systematic approach:
> 1. **🔍 Understand the Problem**: Gather all relevant information and understand how to reproduce the issue.
> 2. **🕵️ Identify the Issue**: Locate where in the code the problem occurs and determine its cause.
> 3. **🔧 Develop a Solution**: Implement a fix for the issue.
> 4. **✅ Test the Solution**: Ensure the problem is resolved and no new issues have been introduced.




> [!TIP]
> The best way to verify your understanding of a topic or some code is to explain it to someone else!

> [!TIP]
> Remember to take **breaks** once in a while to stretch and rest your eyes. The most productive people take regular breaks. Here are some ideas:
> * Work for 25 minutes, then take a 5-minute break.
> * Work for 50 minutes, then take a 15-minute break.
> * Work in 90-minute deep focus sessions, then take a 20–30 minute break.




> [!TIP]
> **Lifelong Learning** is essential in the tech industry. Make it a habit to continously learn throughout your entire career to keep your skills sharp and relevant.
> * Attend workshops
> * Participate in online courses
> * Read technical blogs and documentation
> * Request feedback from others
> * Mentor others

> [!TIP]
> **Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY)** is a principle in software development that encourages avoiding code duplication by using functions, loops, or reusable components. This helps to keep the codebase clean, maintainable, and easier to understand.

### Tips

#### Principles
* ✅ Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY) – Avoid duplicating code by using functions, loops, or reusable components.
* ✅ Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) – Each function or module should do only one thing well.
* ✅ Write self-documenting code – Use meaningful variable and function names instead of relying on excessive comments.
* ✅ Keep it simple (KISS) – Write code that is as simple as possible while still solving the problem.
* ✅ Avoid premature optimization – Focus on clarity first, optimize only when needed.

#### Improving existing code

#### Writing maintainable code
🔹 Consistent Formatting – Use a code formatter (Prettier, Black, ESLint) to enforce styling.
🔹 Use Descriptive Names – Avoid single-letter variable names (except in loops). Example:
🔹 Write Small Functions – Each function should do one thing and be reusable.
🔹 Minimize Side Effects – Use pure functions where possible to avoid unexpected behavior.

#### Troubleshoot issues
🛠 Use print statements/logging first before using a debugger.
🛠 Break down big problems into small steps – Solve one part at a time.
🛠 Rubber duck debugging – Explain your issue out loud (or to an actual duck) to clarify your thinking.
