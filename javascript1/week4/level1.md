> [!IMPORTANT]
> The Level 1 exercises will require you to apply your learnings from previous weeks. We recommend that you start with one exercise. If you find it easy, proceed to the [Level 2 exercises](./level2.md). Otherwise, try another exercise here.

<!-- Simple loops, objects etc -->

## Build Student Grades
In this exercise you will create a basic system to manage student records. Let's get started:

1. **Create Student Objects**
    * Define a function `createStudent(name, age, grades)` that takes a student's name, age, and grades and return an object with these properties.
2. **Store Students in an Array**
    * Create an empty array called `students`.
    * Use the `createStudent` function to create at least three student objects and store them in the students array.
3. **Calculate Average Grade**
    * Write a function `calculateAverageGrade(student)` that takes a student object and returns their average grade.
4. **Find the Best Student**
    * Write a function `findTopStudent(studentsArray)` that takes an array of students and returns the student with the highest average grade.
5.  **Display Student Information**
    * Write a function `displayStudentInfo(student)` that logs a message like:
        `"John, Age: 20, Average Grade: 85"`
    * Use this function to display details for all students in the students array.
6. **Add Grades Dynamically**
    * Modify the `createStudent` function to also include a method `addGrade(newGrade)` inside the student object, allowing new grades to be added dynamically.

Now help us answer these questions for the below students:
 * What is the average grade of Frank?
 * Who has the highest average grades?
 * Who has the lowest average grades?

> * Allan 20 years - Grades: [10, 10, 7, 4, 7]
> * Betty 22 years - Grades: [12, 7, 7, 4, 2]
> * Charlie 21 years - Grades: [10, 7, 4, 2, 0]
> * David 23 years - Grades: [7, 4, 2, 0, -3]
> * Eva 20 years - Grades: [12, 7, 10, 2, 12]
> * Grace 22 years - Grades: [7, 10, 7, 10, 7]
> * Henry 21 years - Grades: [4, 7, 7, 4, 4]
> * Irene 23 years - Grades: [2, 7, 7, 4, 0]


## Build a Shopping Cart
You will create a basic shopping cart system that calculates the total price, applies discounts, and adds taxes.

1. **Create a Visitor Object**
    * Write a function createVisitor(name, age, height, hasPass) and returns an object with these properties. Height should be in cm.
2. **Calculate Ticket Price**
    * Write a function calculateTicketPrice(visitor).
    * Rules:
        * Kids (under 12 years) â†’ $10
        * Teens (12-17 years) â†’ $15
        * Adults (18+) â†’ $20
        * Season Pass Holders â†’ Free!
3. **Ride Eligibility Check** ðŸŽ¡
    * Write a function `canRide(visitor, minHeight)` that returns `true` if the visitor is tall enough, otherwise `false`.
    * Example:
    ```js
    canRide({ name: "Alice", height: 140 }, 120);  // true
    canRide({ name: "Bob", height: 110 }, 120);  // false
    ```

4. **Group Visitors & Total Revenue**
    * Create an array `visitors` with at least 5 visitor objects.
    * Write a function `calculateTotalRevenue(visitors)` that:
        * Loops through all visitors.
        * Adds up the total ticket sales.
        * Returns the total amount earned by the park.

5. **Display Visitor Details**
    * Write a function `displayVisitorInfo(visitor)` that logs:
    ```yaml
    Name: Jake | Age: 14 | Height: 150cm | Ticket Price: $15
    ```

ðŸŽ¯ **Bonus Challenge (Optional)**
    * Add Ride Restrictions: Some rides have both height and age restrictions. Modify `canRide()` to also check minimum age.
    * Family Discount: Modify `calculateTotalRevenue()` to apply a 10% discount if a group has 4 or more visitors.
















## Refactor
```js
function f(x) {
    if (x) {
        return "User is " + x + " years old";
    } else {
        return "No age provided";
    }
}

console.log(f(25)); // "User is 25 years old"
console.log(f("30")); // "User is 30 years old"
console.log(f("thirty")); // "User is thirty years old"
console.log(f(null)); // ???
```


## Troubleshoot

1. Guess the output
```js
const a = 10;
const b = -10;
const c = "100"
const d = "no";
const e = {
    name: "John",
};
const f = [1, 2, 3];
const h = true;

// guess the output of the following statements
console.log("#1", a + a);
console.log("#2", a + b);
console.log("#3", a + c);
console.log("#4", a + d);
console.log("#5", a + e);
console.log("#6", a + e["name"]);
console.log("#7", a + e["age"]);
console.log("#8", a + f);
console.log("#9", a + f[1]);
console.log("#10", a + h);
```



## 1 ðŸŽ“ Troubleshoot issue with grades
Below is a piece of code that is supposed to process a list of students and their grades, and return the average grade for the class. The calculation should ignore any invalid grades (negative numbers or non-numeric grades). However, the code has some bugs. Your task is to identify and fix the issues.
```js
function calculateAverageGrade(students) {
    let total = 0;
    let count = 0;
    
    for (let i = 0; i < students.length; i++) {
        let grade = students[i].grade;
        
        if (grade > 0) {
            total += grade;
            count++;
        } else {
            console.log("Invalid grade for student: " + students[i].name);
        }
    }
    
    return total / count;
}

let studentsList = [
    { name: "Alice", grade: 90 },
    { name: "Bob", grade: -10 },
    { name: "Charlie", grade: 85 },
    { name: "David", grade: 100 },
    { name: "Eva", grade: "A" }
];

console.log("Average grade:", calculateAverageGrade(studentsList)); 
// Expected Output: Average grade: 91.66
```

**Tasks**
1. Identify the bug(s) in the code.
2. Fix the code so that it correctly calculates the average grade for the students.

## 1 ðŸŽ“ Troubleshoot
clean up const / let and variable names


## 1 ðŸŽ“ Built a Recipe Management System
You are tasked with creating a recipe management system. This system will keep track of recipes, each containing:
* The name of the recipe.
* The time it takes to cook the recipe, in minutes.
* A list of ingredients required for the recipe.

```
Spaghetti
30 min
spaghetti, tomato sauce, garlic

Salad
10 min
lettuce, tomato, cucumber, olive oil

Pancakes
20 min
flour, milk, eggs, sugar
```

**Tasks**
1. Create a list with the below recipes. Each recipes which each have a name, time, and ingredients.
2. Write a method to find the fastest recipe based on the cooking time.
3. Write another method to find all recipes that contain specific ingredients. The function should take an array of ingredients as an argument and return all recipes that contain any of those ingredients.



## 1 ðŸŽ“ Built
1. Write a function called sumEvenNumbers that takes an array of numbers and returns the sum of only the even numbers in the array.
```js
sumEvenNumbers([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]); 
// Expected output: 12 (because 2 + 4 + 6 = 12)

sumEvenNumbers([10, 15, 20, 25]); 
// Expected output: 30 (because 10 + 20 = 30)
```

## 1 ðŸŽ“ Built
1. Write a function that takes an array of numbers and returns the second largest number. If there aren't enough unique numbers, return null.
```js
console.log(secondLargest([10, 20, 4, 45, 99])); // 45
console.log(secondLargest([3, 3, 3])); // null
console.log(secondLargest([5])); // null
console.log(secondLargest([])); // null
```


## 1 ðŸŽ“ Refactor
1. Describe in your own words to a team mate or mentor what this code does
2. The code is hard to read due to poor naming. Can you improve it? (there might be more than just the names to improve) 
```js
function filterItems(list) {
    let result = [];
    for (let i = 0; i < list.length; i++) {
        if (list[i].price < 20 && list[i].inStock) {
            let item = list[i].item;
            result.push(item);
        }
    }
    return result;
}

let shpitms = [
    { item: "Apple", price: 1.5, inStock: true },
    { item: "Laptop", price: 999.99, inStock: true },
    { item: "T-shirt", price: 15, inStock: false },
    { item: "Bananas", price: 2, inStock: true },
    { item: "Headphones", price: 25, inStock: true }
];

console.log(filterItems(shpitms)); 
// Expected Output: ["Apple", "Bananas"]

```
