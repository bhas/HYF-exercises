> [!IMPORTANT]
> Top 3 most important soft-skills to land your first job:
> * Problem-Solving
> * Communication & Collaboration
> * Continuous Learning & Adaptability


## Hard & Soft Skills
When you start applying for jobs, you will notice a significant focus on hard skills. However, this does not diminish the importance of soft skills. In Denmark, there is generally a greater emphasis on soft skills compared to many other countries. 

Also, as you become more senior there will be a higher demand for soft skills.   

#### Why Does Denmark Value Soft Skills Highly?
* Danish companies often have a flat structure, where developers are expected to take responsibility, communicate openly, and work closely with colleagues and managers.
* Many Danish tech companies follow Scrum and other agile methodologies, where teamwork and communication are key to success.
* Developers in Denmark are expected to take ownership of their tasks and actively participate in decision-making processes.
* Denmark has a strong consensus culture, meaning that decisions are often made through discussion and mutual agreement. This requires good communication skills, collaboration, and the ability to consider different perspectives.
