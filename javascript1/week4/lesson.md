> * Communication & Collaboration
> * Continuous Learning & Adaptability
>
> Common disciplines of a developer:
> * **Building** new code

## Hard & Soft Skills

| **Hard skills** | **Soft skills** |

When you start applying for jobs you will experience that there is a lot of focus on hard skills. However, it does not mean soft skills are not important. Denmark generally places more emphasis on soft skills compared to many other countries. And as you grow your career and go for promotions you are 

Also, as you become more senior there will be a higher demand for strong soft skills.   

#### Why Does Denmark Value Soft Skills Highly?
* Danish companies often have a flat structure, where developers are expected to take responsibility, communicate openly, and work closely with colleagues and managers.
* Many Danish tech companies follow Scrum and other agile methodologies, where teamwork and communication are key to success.
* Developers in Denmark are expected to take ownership of their tasks and actively participate in decision-making processes.
* Denmark has a strong consensus culture, meaning that decisions are often made through discussion and mutual agreement. This requires good communication skills, collaboration, and the ability to consider different perspectives.

## Disciplines of a Software Developer
Here are the four main disciplines you will have as a future software developer. You will develop and enhance these skills throughout your time at HYF, during your final project, and in your future career.


### 🧱 **Implement** new code
Writing new code, implementing features, and developing applications.
* Design a solution
* Break it up into subtasks
* Implement the code
* Verify that it works as expected

> [!TIP]
> **Divide and Conquer** is a programming technique that breaks a problem into smaller, more manageable subproblems, solves them individually, and then combines their solutions to solve the original problem. It is used to reduce problem complexity and making it easier to design and estimate the solution.

### ✨ Reviewing existing code
Assessing and improving existing code through code reviews, refactoring, and optimization.
 * Understanding how the old code works
 * Identifying ways to improve the code:
     * Readability - how easy is the code to understand for other developers?
     * Maintainability - how easy is the code to extend with new features?
     * Performance - How fast is the code?
 * Refactor the code and verify that it works as expected

> [!TIP]
> When refactoring existing code there is always a risk that we introduce bugs, so it is crucial that you take precautions to reduce the risk of introducing bugs. Here are some good steps to follow which limits these risks:
> 1. **🔍 Understand the Code**: Thoroughly read and understand the existing code.
> 2. **📝 Plan Changes**: Outline the changes you intend to make and weigh the effort required against the benefits.
> 3. **🧪 Create Test Scenarios**: Develop test scenarios and document their expected outcomes.
> 4. **💻 Implement Changes**: Make the necessary code changes.
> 5. **✅ Verify Functionality**: Ensure that your test scenarios still pass after the changes.



### 🔥 **Troubleshoot** issues
Identifying, diagnosing, and resolving issues in the code.
* Understand requirements
* Communicate with users
* Test your application

> [!TIP]
> Effective troubleshooting involves a systematic approach:
> 1. **🔍 Understand the Problem**: Gather all relevant information and understand how to reproduce the issue.
> 2. **🕵️ Identify the Issue**: Locate where in the code the problem occurs and determine its cause.
> 3. **🔧 Develop a Solution**: Implement a fix for the issue.
> 4. **✅ Test the Solution**: Ensure the problem is resolved and no new issues have been introduced.


### ✨ Reviewing existing code 
 * Understanding old code
 * identifying areas for improvement
 * refactor code and test that it works

> [!TIP]
> The best way to verify your understanding of a topic or some code is to explain it to someone else!

> [!TIP]
> Remember to take **breaks** once in a while to stretch and rest your eyes. The most productive people take regular breaks. Here are some ideas:
> * Work for 25 minutes, then take a 5-minute break.
> * Work for 50 minutes, then take a 15-minute break.
> * Work in 90-minute deep focus sessions, then take a 20–30 minute break.


### 🎓 Learn 

### 🎓 **Learn** new concepts and technologies
Continuously expanding your knowledge and skills by learning new programming languages, frameworks, tools, and best practices.
* Finding sources for information
* Being curious
* Trying it out!
* Explaining it to a teammate

> [!TIP]
> **Lifelong Learning** is essential in the tech industry. Make it a habit to continously learn throughout your entire career to keep your skills sharp and relevant.
> * Attend workshops
> * Participate in online courses
> * Read technical blogs and documentation
> * Request feedback from others
> * Mentor others
